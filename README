This is my Simple Multiple Programs Builder, a set of scripts I wrote to build many programs with just one command. When working on multiple programs and libraries, you have to `make && make install` each component that changed, in the correct order. With this tool you just run build.sh and watch as the program you work on is build and run.

To use it, just create a symbolic link my-project/ to your project's source code directory and a mini-makefile my-project.mk and drop them in the src/ directory, and then call build.sh.

Please note that this is not intended to be portable or generic or anything. This is intended to be small and easy to hack.
